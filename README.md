# YoutubeKeywordsTool

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders.

- main - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- tests - Unit tests for the application code. 
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The AWS Toolkit also adds a simplified step-through debugging experience for Lambda function code. See the following links to get started.

# YouTube Related Keywords Finder

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that finds related keywords for a given keyword using the YouTube Data API. You can deploy this application using the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders:

- main - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses the YouTube Data API to fetch related keywords. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

## Deploy the Sample Application

To deploy the application, you need the following tools:

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* Python 3 - [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

After installing the necessary tools, run the following commands in your shell:

```bash
sam build --use-container
sam deploy --guided

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build --use-container` command.

```bash
YoutubeKeywordsTool$ sam build --use-container
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `main/requirements.txt`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
YoutubeKeywordsTool$ sam local invoke YoutubeKeywordsToolFunction --event events/event.json
```

The SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
YoutubeKeywordsTool$ sam local start-api
YoutubeKeywordsTool$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
      Events:
        YoutubeKeywordsTool:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```

## Add a resource to your application
The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in 
[the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard 
[AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
YoutubeKeywordsTool$ sam logs -n YoutubeKeywordsToolFunction --stack-name "YoutubeKeywordsTool" --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project. Use PIP to install the test dependencies and run tests.

```bash
YoutubeKeywordsTool$ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt --user
# unit test
YoutubeKeywordsTool$ python -m pytest tests/unit -v
# integration test, requiring deploying the stack first.
# Create the env variable AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME with the name of the stack we are testing
YoutubeKeywordsTool$ AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME="YoutubeKeywordsTool" python -m pytest tests/integration -v
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
sam delete --stack-name "YoutubeKeywordsTool"
```
